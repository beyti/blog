&lt;p>Anyone with a non-english country probably has one or more languages and probably their respective keyboard layouts available to them.&lt;br>
In Turkey, we have a Turkish-Q keyboard layout and our keyboards are mostly in this layout as hardware.&lt;br>

It seems there&amp;rsquo;s a bug in Windows so you can&amp;rsquo;t do what you&amp;rsquo;ve been able to do previously.&lt;br>
