      <description>A Netflix movie called Stutz It is a soft documentary about a psychiatrist, Phil Stutz. Documentary successfully depicts Stutz&amp;rsquo;s methods on with his catchy symbolic sketchs and namings for which I&amp;rsquo;ve understood as existentialism based psych therapy.
Why watch it Well, it is easy to absorb content about useful and practical methodologies to deal with lots of existial obstacles a lot of folks (like me) constantly has to deal with. Plus, Phil is really heart warming and genuine, even from the digital screen you watch him, which makes you feel warm when watching.</description>
